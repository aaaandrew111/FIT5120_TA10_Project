Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Up front, these lights are not mellow yellow, they are WHITE. But, it you need a good bright white light in your room, these are the ones you need.

LED's are more expensive on the front end, but the decreased operating costs are supposed to pay for these lights over time. Another factoid that most people do not realize is that the newer ceiling fans with lights will NOT take any bulb over 60w. If you have a three light fan, then that is 180 watts total, two is 120 watts. If the light shade is anything but white the light will be dimmed accordingly. Not knowing that, we initially had two CFL's in the lamp but soon found out that the room was really dark at night. I purchased these two bulbs that are both each equivalent of 100 watt incandescent bulbs and I was surprised how bright they are. The only problem is that the light comes out of the LED bulb somewhat directional due to its design, if you look at it the light bulb design the light bounces out of the white cover on top of the bulb. For a floor lamp or a desk lamp this design would not be a  problem, but since my application requires the lamp to be inserted at a horizontal direction (instead of top to bottom as you would in a table lamp) the light tends to not diffuse through the shade as well as a CFL or an incandescent would, instead it directs the light towards the walls instead of the ceiling. I think that you will get used to the light after a while. Ideally a LED that illuminates at a 360 degree axis like a CFL or incandescent would be better.

The white light is also something to get used to. It is much brighter than the CFL's and incandescents and more appealing especially if you are a reader or have evening low-light sight problems."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I purchased this switch to replace the small molded on-off switch on a 1-1/2 horsepower, 120V air compressor.  That original switch lasted only about 4 months.  The Leviton web site says: ""HP Rating: 2HP-120V 2HP-240V-277V""  so the switch should have no problem with my compressor.  I installed it a few weeks ago, and it's been working fine.

I took the third one and the fourth one and now it's a little smaller.  I'm glad I did.  I'm happy I did.  I'm not a fan of the sound quality of the speakers on these computers.  They are very loud and the speakers are not as loud as they sound.  It's very annoying.  I have to get my computer speakers to work, and I'm not sure how long I'll have to wait.  They work great.  The sound quality is not great, but it's ok.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.This is a great camera for the price.  I was able to find some great reviews for it, but I haven't found any good ones.  I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a great camera for the price.I have a Nikon D7000 and it's about $300 cheaper than this.  The only reason I give it 5 stars is that the lens is a bit wide open, so you can see your subject better without the ability to see where you are looking.  I had a little trouble getting it to open, but after a few minutes it was just a little bit wider.  I am very happy with the camera and would buy again.  The quality is good.I've had this for 2 months now.  It works great, but I'm not sure if it's because I have it plugged in and connected to a different router.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,"This is my first time using this and the dogs love it. My only complaint is the extra suction cup. I wish it came in the plastic one so it would hold up to the biting and biting. I would have liked it if it had a thicker plastic bowl. I would have liked to have gotten it in the plastic one instead. It has a very thin plastic base, so I wish I had bought it in the plastic one. I will have to check the size on the next time. I will update this review as I see it. I am really glad I bought this product. I would not have bought it in the plastic one. I have been using this to keep my dogs ears clean for several years and I have found it to be effective. It is very absorbent and absorbs more than my other shampoo products. I have not had any issues with skin irritation as a result. My cats love this food. They are about 20 lbs. They have been eating it for several years. The cats have never had any issues with the food, and I believe that it is a healthy food for them. I also have the odd cat that we mix with it, which is quite a challenge for us. The food is good quality and the cats love it. I will be ordering more of the other brands. Great quality. My dogs love it. I bought this for a friend who has a dog with a sensitive stomach.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I have to agree with the above posters. When I saw the price for these I cringed but my hearing is more important than 50 bucks so I ordered these and slapped them on. Yes, they are really great, no more gaps that let in unwanted sound when I turn my head. Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.

My brother bought a pair of Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffs and I tried them on and the earcups have a lot of gaps that let in sound and don't even have the option to upgrade the cups 8(, Pretty sad when those earmuffs cost $50.

I own a pair of 3M Peltor Tactical Sport Hearing Protector, MP3 Compatible $97,99 which I purchased here on Amazon. I bought these gelpacks for them and now I'm satisfied with the protection. Sad the manufacturer's for most of these headsets use inadequate cups out of the box. Anyways, these gelpacks will provide a much better seal and help save your hearing. Be well, be safe."

They are great to work with, have wonderful customer service and their rugs are a beautiful addition to our home. We received this awesome animal zoo print one and have places it beside our little girl, Giselle's bed! She has been loving it! It is so fun for her to be able to enjoy the comfort of the rug and use it as a useful learning too while she is beginning to learn how to identify different animals. This rug depicts a hippo, a camel, an elephant and our personal favorite...a giraffe! We actually had a bit of a scare in the middle of the night the other day, when Giselle was sleeping too close to the edge of her bed and accidentally fell to the floor. Luckily for us, we had this rug laid down so it helped tremendously to break her fall. It is very thick and cushioned, so she was able to brace the impact on her head and body! Ironic, but it we felt the rug was meant to be there for her.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Quiet,strong,handsome,shy when it comes to women, has trouble making decisions and the inability to  say ""NO"" to anyone describe this Hot, Hunky, Cowboy version of a tarnished saint. James Taylor sold his ranch in Texas, ended a 3 year relationship to a women he did not love and came home to raise his horses.  Mindy MacAllister has made mistakes and paid the price.  She wants to find someone who will love her despite of her past and raise a family.  When the Taylor brothers Aunt Cappy talks her into coming home, she jumps at the chance hoping to see the one Taylor brother that has held her heart since she was a child.  Nothing worth wild is easy in life and the budding relationship between the two characters is a prime example of this.  Aunt Cappy's meddling, the other tarnished saints not so helpful help and the past that does not want to stay in the past make for an entertaining reading experience. James has a big heart and a lot of love to give and is the first tarnished saint that I have read about who has an almost perfect halo.  If he could just learn to say no and make decisions he could probably ascend and become the first Taylor saint."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I did not buy this for hanging deer. I built a 9'x8' shelf in my garage and established it at about 4.5 feet so a car's nose could go under it, but there would still be sufficient room to store meaningful items on top of it (like snow blowers, lawn mowers, generators, etc...). The problem is getting the seasonal equipment onto the shelf. Most of it is pretty darn heavy. I initially looked into some block & tackle systems but was shocked at the prices for what I considered very modest quality. I finally settled on this as a lift system. I was about a third the cost of the cheapest block & tackle and better quality. I use the hangar part that you affix the deer legs to as the lifting hook and bolted the rest to the ceiling just a few inches out from the shelf. Using this system, I can lift by myself a 150 pound snowthrower 4.5 feet into the air and onto the shelf I made for the season once spring arrives. Bicycles, lawn mowers, BBQ, etc... works great and much more economical than the pulley systems being sold today."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I've had this filled with a mix of chocolate and nuts for about a month now. I keep it stored in the refrigerator and so far we've used it to grate nuts and chocolate over ice cream as a topping, sprinkled over oatmeal, added to brownie batter before baking, and  it has even been used to grate pecans directly onto pancakes.

This mill comes with two different size blades. The smaller blade grates very small, the nuts come out looking like a nut meal. I prefer the larger size blade, nuts and chocolate come out with a nicer texture. The extra blade can be stored inside of the cap, which is a very nice feature.

I like the viewing windows on the side, you can see at a glance if you need to refill. I learned not  fill it too full, if filled too full screwing the cap back on can become a bit of a challenge. This mill seems to work better when it is lightly filled anyways, especially if you have a mix of different items inside so you can get a better mix when you turn the mill.

Just turn the mill like you would a pepper grinder and the grated nuts, cheese, or chocolate come out the bottom. There is a small cap that fits over the bottom that helps keep everything fresh and also helps keep any stray crumbs contained. This is very easy to use and helps make baked goods look a tiny bit fancier. This mill is a useful little kitchen gadget that I find myself using much more than I thought I would.

Electronics_5,3.0,CG,I bought this so my old ones couldn't be used anymore. This is the first one I've owned that had a plastic screen protector and is the first one I've purchased that does not have a screen protector. I am very pleased with the quality of the product. I love it. Works great. I did not want the cable to fall out of the charger. I didn't want the cable to be bent over and on my charger.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,CG,"Just got these in the mail a couple of days ago and they are still beautiful! I just ordered a pair in the same color, but they have a different pattern. They were sent back with a small tag saying they were a gift for a friend. I don't know how long the necklace will last but I love the color and the fact that the necklace is a little longer than I expected. I will keep them and wear them for a long time!Love these shoes!  They are very comfortable, very easy to put on, and very soft.  I have a wide foot and these shoes are perfect.  I do recommend these shoes.Love them!  I ordered a size up for my son and he loves them!Great Fit, Great Product. I've had a few pairs of this brand before, but never really used them for anything. I wear a size 8.5, and these fit perfectly. I will order a size 7, and they will fit. My only problem is that the fabric is thin, and the shoe is way too loose. I'm going to have to wear a very thin shoe, and the heel would be a bit more comfortable for me.I love this shirt, it fits great, and it's a little big.  I bought a small and it fit fine.  It is well made and it's very comfortable.I like the color and the fit.  I love the drawstring.I love the way it looks and the size.  I'm 5'6"" and 125 lbs. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly.  It is a little tight around my waist and the waistband is a"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,CG,This book got off to a slow start with the third chapter.  There were a few typos and mistakes but the story kept going.  The characters were great.  I enjoyed this book.

Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"The advanced power strip surge protection has been an important part of my travel setup. I have used the power strip surge protector in the past and it is the best protection I have purchased. The power strip surge protection is in the middle of the enclosure. This enclosure is still very secure. I have a 2. 5"" portable hub and a 2. 5"" laptop hub. I also use a USB hub on the laptop and a 2. 5"" USB hub on the hub. The enclosure is very secure. I have not used the USB hub yet but I will update when I do. I have a few more questions for you, but I can't answer them. I'll just say that this enclosure does a good job protecting your laptop and the hub. I've had no problems with the enclosure. I have used it for almost a month now and it does a good job."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"A little snug around the calves, but they are cute and relatively comfortable. They're not super high quality, but I think they'll probably last me a season or two."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Cute stickers of Pusheen, but wished the stickers were a little larger in size. But they are cute still and like them."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"This is a movie really meant to be watched in a theatre, instead I watched it on a Kindle 10"" Fire HDX.  The visuals and CGI are superb, easily the best since the now ancient Apollo 13.  Sandra Bullock & George Clooney give good performances.  Unfortunately the story & script just don't hold up under even minor scrutiny.  Space Shuttle crews trained together for a year more before a mission, but from the start, Clooney as mission commander, appears to have only just met Bullock, who plays a scientist intent of upgrading the Hubble telescope.  Later, it's made known that Clooney doesn't know even where Bullock lives.  For me, a thread of unbelievability runs throughout the movie, which could easily have been fixed had the producers hired a genuine SST astronaut as an advisor to the script."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I have pretty poor circulation in my fingers and toes and it's really difficult to find a pair of gloves that keep me warm. These almost do, and when the gloves and my hands are initially warm they work well. If the gloves are cold and my hands are cold (due to removing them outside for a reason) they do not work as well as I hoped. I bought them new but off Ebay for around $90 so I am keeping them. At that price they are a good deal. At over $150 I say look elsewhere. I know mitts have better heat ratings, so I might try those next, but I just like the feel of a glove when I ski."

Thank you."
